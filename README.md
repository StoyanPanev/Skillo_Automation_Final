# Final Skillo Project
This is my final project for testing http://training.skillo-bg.com:4200/posts/all website.

The tests I include are:

**Successful Registration** - Enter valid credentials with a username that is not already in use (username, email, password, confirm password).

**Unsuccessful Registration** - Leave the email field empty.

**Valid Login** - Enter an already registered username and password.

**Invalid Login** - Enter a username that is not in use.

**Change Public Info** - Log in with valid credentials and modify public information in the profile.

**Post Test** - Create a new post with an already registered user. Upload a picture and write a caption.

**Profile Photo** - Change the profile photo of a registered user.

**Comment on Post Without Logging In** - Attempt to write a comment on a post without logging in. It should not be possible.
